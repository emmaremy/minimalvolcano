# Volcano Explorer

An interactive map of volcanoes using [GVP](http://volcano.si.edu/) data, created with R Shiny and Leaflet. You can find the map [here](http://52.22.110.202:3838/eremy1/minimalvolcano/), assuming Swarthmore's Shiny server is up and running. This was created in Spring 2016 as part of a directed reading with Dr. Kelly McConville, and then was uploaded here. This was presented at 2017's [Electronic Undergraduate Statistics Research Conference](https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/eusrc/2017/virtual-posters).
